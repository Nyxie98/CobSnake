# CobSnake
This is a simple Snake game I wrote in a few hours in COBOL

The code isn't great, I will need to do some fixes, but it is definitely working
which is good enough for me.

To run this, make sure you have `GnuCobol` installed, then run `./run.sh`.

That will compile the game, and run it too.

If you just want to compile the game, remove the `./main` from the `run.sh` file.
